I am a self-taught programmer who has been working in the Water Infrastructure industry for 5 years. I was always interested in programming, but never had any formal training. My love of learning and curiosity led me to find ways of teaching myself new skills on my own time. I loved learning about machine learning and I decided to take data science more seriously.

The Mathematics and Statistics was the first class I took and it really got me interested in learning more about data science. These courses really helped me learn the fundamentals of data science and how to apply them. I'm doing projects for myself focussed on Data Analysis and Data Visualisation using Python.
